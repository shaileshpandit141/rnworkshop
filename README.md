# **rnworkshop**

This is my personal learning project for **React Native** using **Expo** and **Expo Router**.
The goal of this app is to help me practice React Native concepts, build UI components, explore navigation, and experiment with mobile features step-by-step.

## 📚 **Purpose of this App**

* Learn React Native by building small examples
* Practice using **Expo Router**
* Create a clean project structure
* Experiment with components, layouts, animations, and APIs
* Build my personal library of reusable code

## 🛠️ **Technologies**

* Expo
* React Native
* Expo Router
* TypeScript

## 🧭 **Notes for Myself**

* All new pages go inside the `app/` folder
* `index.tsx` acts like the home route

## ✨ **Goal**

This project is only for my personal practice to grow as a React Native developer.
